William Braga - CS 2110 Spring 2019

My GBA Game is based off the card game Egyptian Rat Screw (Rat Slap).

On the title screen, you may press B for instructions on how to play.
Otherwise, you may continue by pressing START.

After, you will choose your opponent by moving the cursor with the arrow keys and pressing A:
UGA GRAD has no bonuses
CS2110 HYRDA has a speed bonus
BUZZ YEETERSON has an accuracy bonus
ZVI has a significant speed and accuracy bonus

Once in the game, you may press B to draw a card from your deck facedown and
place it on the card pile.

You may also press A to slap the deck.

The conditions to slap the deck in this game are as follows:
DOUBLES (Last two cards had the same value) (e.g. 7, 7 / 2, 2 / K, K)
SANDWICHES (Two cards have the same value with another card in between) (e.g. 7, 2, 7 / K, J, K) 
TENS (Last one or two cards' value add up to 10) (e.g. 9, A / 4, 6 / 10)
MARRIAGE (Last two cards were a king and a queen) (e.g. Q, K / K, Q)

Slapping correctly wins the player the card pile.
Slapping incorrectly causes the player to "burn" a card by putting it in the bottom of the card pile.

The game continues until one player runs out of cards.
